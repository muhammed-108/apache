Step 1 Install the dependent module.
Run the following command to install mod_ssl:
yum install -y mod_ssl


Step 2 Create a self-signed certificate.
Run the following commands to create a private key:
mkdir ca
cd ca
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
Use the private key to generate a CA certificate.
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout ca.key -x509 -days 3650 -out ca.crt

Generate a request file using the private key and CA certificate.
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout www.test1.com.key -out www.test1.com.csr
Issue a certificate to the server.
openssl x509 -req -days 36500 -in www.test1.com.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out
www.test1.com.crt

Step 3 Specify a certificate file.
Run the following command to open the SSL configuration file:
vim /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf

Add a static resolution entry to the client to resolve www.test1.com to the EIP of
Server01.
Enter https://www.test1.com in the address box of the browser. The following page is
displayed.

Click Advanced and select Proceed to www.test1.com (unsafe). The following page is
